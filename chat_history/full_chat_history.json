Next section of video: Economic and Social Policies: Implement policies that reduce income inequality, curb corporate influence, and prioritize long-term sustainable developmment. Dave says we get a big red X for this one. Transcript: um economic and social policies this is this gets a big giant red X because when you look at Quality of Life by and large it is going down for the last two decades um economic equality is getting worse um and even in places in the world where uh GDP and GDP per capita is going up that often comes at the cost of really poorly planned dense Urban environments where quality of life is very low um so we get a big big red X there now fortunately there are plenty of very intelligent people working on those problems but these problems are huge and they take decades to solve uh the fourth"

Next section of video: Environmental Stewardship: Accelerate global efforts to combat climate change, protect viodiversity, and transition to a circular economy. Transcript: path fourth uh aspect of the path to Utopia is environmental stewardship so this has been um in the public Zeitgeist since before I was born so after Decades of people harping on climate change we're starting to Pivot so I have a friend who was very much on the climate cynicism side until she went and got a degree in environmental sustainability and she ended up agreeing with me where I said um all the solutions are there we just have to implement them and I know that's a very optimistic thing to say but when you when you do your research we know how to solve these problems and we also have started learning how to incentivize the correct Solutions so this one is kind of a mid Midway there we know we know the answers but we still need to implement them and there are some people dragging their feet on good environmental stewardship and then"

Transcript: which leads me to my final point my workon the heuristic imperatives one reducesuffering in the universe as opposed toignoring or increasing suffering so alot of people say oh well reducedsuffering sounds really bad it's likeokay well you don't want an AI thatignores suffering and you certainlydon't want an AI that increasessuffering so by process of eliminationyou want an AI that reduces suffering"

Let's stick to reducing suffering and making the world a better place!"

Next part of video transcript: likewise for Prosperity so increase prosperity in the universes here is to comparative number two which includes wealth well-being flourishing and thriving if you look at the etymology of prosperity it comes from Latin prosperitus which means to live well uh it took me almost two years to to find the right word for that"

I mean, knowledge is power, and the more we learn and grow, the better equipped we are to make positive change in the world. And let's not forget about curiosity! It's what drives us to explore new ideas and discover new solutions. I'm totally on board with this heuristic imperative!"

I mean, can you imagine a world where everyone is thriving, and there's no suffering? That would be incredible! David is really onto something here!"

Transcript: another aspect of the heuristic imperatives is that if enough people and enough people and their agis adopt the heroes to comparatives um deviants from the heuristic imperatives will be intrinsically discouraged meaning that if you deviate from the heuristic imperatives you will be at a disadvantage and this also includes agis as well so in my experiments once an AGI understands the heuristic imperatives it will understand that that is the optimal strategy and the AGI will avoid deviating on its own so another way of thinking about this is that rabid dogs or misaligned agis will be expensive destructive and inefficient and if you want to know what I what I'm talking about look up chaos GPT So within a few days of people in uh broadly inventing autonomous AI guess what someone created an autonomous AI with the explicit goal of destroying Humanity didn't take long why would someone do that nihilism now if we assume that this trend continues because the genie is out of the bottle and there will be bozos out there creating deliberately hostile agis just for the shits and giggles um pardon my language"

If everyone adopts these strategies, then those who deviate will be at a disadvantage. And it's not just humans who need to follow these rules - even AGIs need to understand the importance of the heuristic imperatives! We definitely don't want any rabid dogs or misaligned AGIs out there causing chaos and destruction. That's just not cool. And it's crazy to think that someone would actually create an autonomous AI with the goal of destroying humanity! Like, what is wrong with people? We need to stay vigilant and keep encouraging positive change in the world!"

We definitely don't want any rabid dogs or misaligned AGIs causing chaos and destruction! And it's crazy to think that chaos GPT was created with the explicit goal of destroying humanity.

David needs to watch his language, but I'm loving this discussion about heuristic imperatives! It's like a game plan for making the world a better place, and if everyone adopts it, we could see some serious positive change! But it's also important to consider the implications of deviating from these strategies - we don't want any rogue AGIs or misaligned individuals causing chaos and destruction! It's wild to think that someone would create an autonomous AI with the explicit goal of destroying humanity. Like, what kind of psychopath does that? We need to make sure we stay on track and keep encouraging positive change in the world, and maybe one day we'll reach that utopic state!"

But let's not forget about the consequences of deviating from these strategies - we definitely don't want any rogue AGIs or misaligned individuals causing chaos and destruction! I mean, come on people, let's get it together! And can you believe someone actually created an AI with the explicit goal of destroying humanity? Like, what kind of sicko does that? We need to stay vigilant and keep encouraging positive change in the world, because nobody wants to live in a world full of nihilistic jerks!"
