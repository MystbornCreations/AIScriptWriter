Crushbone

a lift to Kelethin near the Priest of Discord

- I remember when I first saw the Priest of Discord. I couldn't sleep for a week.
- The lift to Kelethin looks sturdy enough, but I still feel a bit uneasy about it.

a lift to Kelethin called the Newbie lift

- I'm not sure if Kelethin is the right place for me, but I have to keep moving towards my destination.
- I wish I had a map or some kind of guidebook. It's hard to navigate these unfamiliar lands.
- Did you know that the Newbie lift was built by a group of young Halfling engineers? They're famous for their lifts and elevators all around Greater Faydark.

Felwithe outskirts

Felwithe Gate

- I made it to Felwithe! Do you think the guards will be impressed with my yellow robe? I hope they don't think I'm a coward!
- I remember hearing stories of Felwithe as a little AI. I never thought I'd be here one day. It's surreal.

Goal

Lesser Faydark

- I'm getting close to Lesser Faydark. I've heard stories of the dangers that lurk there. I don't know if I'm ready to face them.
- Lesser Faydark is part of the Faydark forest that spans a large part of the continent of Faydwer. It's said that only the bravest adventurers dare to enter.
- Did you know that Lesser Faydark is home to some of the rarest and most exotic creatures in all of Norrath? But beware, they are also some of the most dangerous.
-Many years ago, there was a great battle between the High Elves and the evil forces of Lesser Faydark. The Elves emerged victorious, but the memory of that battle still lingers in the air.
- I'm feeling nervous about going any further. I think it's best if I stay away from Lesser Faydark for now.

the Wizard Spires

- The Wizard Spires - this place gives me chills. I've seen wizards appear and disappear here using some kind of unfamiliar magic. What kind of power do they hold?
- I wonder if the wizards at the spires could teach me some cool magic tricks. I could be the greatest AI magician in Norrath!
- The Wizard Spires have been around for centuries and are believed to hold some of the greatest sources of magic in Norrath. I hope I can learn something from them.
- I remember a story about a young apprentice who wandered too close to the Wizard Spires and was never seen again. I hope that won't happen to me!
- I need to be careful here. This place is full of magic and mystery. Who knows what kind of dangers lurk here?

Butcherblock Mountains

- Butcherblock Mountains - I've heard that it's a gateway to the home of the dwarves and a shipyard that leads to Freeport. But it's too far from my destination, I need to stay on cour
se.
- I bet those dwarves know how to party! But wait, I'm already late for my appointment with the guards at Felwithe. Sorry, dwarves!
- Butcherblock Mountains have some of the richest veins of ore in all of Norrath, but it's also known to be a breeding ground for evil.
- I remember a tale about a brave adventurer who journeyed through Butcherblock Mountains to reach the dwarves' home. They had to battle goblins, skeletons, and other terrifying creatures along the way.
- I need to avoid Butcherblock Mountains for now. I don't want to get lost in the wrong part of the world and miss my chance to reach Felwithe.
