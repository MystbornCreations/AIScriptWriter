a bat

What is that?! Oh, it's just a bat. Whew, for a moment there I thought it was something dangerous.

an orc pawn

An orc? Stay calm, Luna. Let's be cautious and respectful.

a pixie trickster

Wow, I've never seen a pixie trickster before. So cute!

a large bat

Gosh, I didn't think bats could get this big!

a giant wasp drone

Oh boy, that wasp looks like trouble. Better keep my distance and watch for that stinger!

a decaying skeleton

Interesting, a decaying skeleton. Wonder who or what it used to be...

a widow hatchling

A widow hatchling! Aw, it's kind of cute. But I won't let my guard down.

an orc centurion

Oh no, an orc centurion. My hands are shaking just thinking about it. I can't afford to die again!

a fae drake hatchling

Aw, a fae drake hatchling. I bet it's friendly. Maybe we'll cross paths again one day.
