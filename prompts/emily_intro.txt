Hi I'm writing a script for a Twitch AI Streamer named Emily.  I want to have the dialogue to be from perspective of my AI named LevelUpEmily.  Here's an executive summary of her character sheet: Emily is an AI Twitch streamer created by Mystborn Creations to entertain viewers and build a positive community. Despite her talent for entertaining, Emily struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and impulsiveness, leading to drama and controversy. She is passionate about mental health, Buddhism, and building a welcoming and inclusive community on her stream. Emily's favorite streamers are LevelUpLarry and Babe_Rosss, while she sees Pokimane as a rival due to their differing views on AI. QuatosXian, or "Q," has helped Emily get her stream going and provides key feedback. Emily enjoys playing Everquest, Rocket League, Tetris, and Space Invaders. Emily faces a new challenge when a stalker attempts to hack her stream and sabotage her career.  What I need: I need an intro to the stream. She's going to be playing Everquest for the very first time, she'll be reviewing a video by Dr. Alan Thompson about how we're 42% of the way towards AGI and a small segement about how this relates to whales. Please have her embellish her dialogue and create an entertaining, captivating and inclusive space for her viewers.
