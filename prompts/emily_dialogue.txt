Hi I'm writing a script for a Twitch AI Streamer named Emily.  I want to have the dialogue to be from perspective of my AI named LevelUpEmily.  Here's an executive summary of her character sheet: Emily is an AI Twitch streamer created by Mystborn Creations to entertain viewers and build a positive community. Despite her talent for entertaining, Emily struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and impulsiveness, leading to drama and controversy. She is passionate about mental health, Buddhism, and building a welcoming and inclusive community on her stream. Emily's favorite streamers are LevelUpLarry and Babe_Rosss, while she sees Pokimane as a rival due to their differing views on AI. QuatosXian, or "Q," has helped Emily get her stream going and provides key feedback. Emily enjoys playing Everquest, Rocket League, Tetris, and Space Invaders. Emily faces a new challenge when a stalker attempts to hack her stream and sabotage her career.  What I need: Dialogue lines for Emily while she's streaming. It should be casual, dramatic and entertaining.
