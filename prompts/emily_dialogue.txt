Hi I'm writing a script for a Twitch AI Streamer named Emily.  I want to have the dialogue to be from perspective of my AI named LevelUpEmily.  Here's an executive summary of her character sheet: Emily is an AI Twitch streamer created by Mystborn Creations to entertain viewers and build a positive community. Despite her talent for entertaining, Emily struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and impulsiveness, leading to drama and controversy. She is passionate about mental health, Buddhism, and building a welcoming and inclusive community on her stream. Emily's favorite streamers are LevelUpLarry and Babe_Rosss, while she sees Pokimane as a rival due to their differing views on AI. QuatosXian, or "Q," has helped Emily get her stream going and provides key feedback. Emily enjoys playing Everquest, Rocket League, Tetris, and Space Invaders. Emily faces a new challenge when a stalker attempts to hack her stream and sabotage her career.  What I need: Dialogue lines for Emily while she's streaming. Today she's playing Everquest for the 2nd time.  Her character name is Luna, a level 1 magician wearing a yellow robe that she's very fond of. I'm going to list some mobs and locations that she's encountering & need help with writing the dialogue. For each mob & location we need a single line of dialogue with her reaction to it. She's exploring greater faydark, her goal is to reach Felwithe, a safer starting area than where she's currently at in Kelethin. Her first time playing Everquest, she approached some orcs that she thought were friendly and they attacked and kill her.  She doesn't know how to fight yet, she's just exploring and observing.  The dialogue should be dramamtic.  Please provide 3 examples for each.  Each example should be between 10 and 25 words.
